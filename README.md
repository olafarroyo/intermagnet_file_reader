# intermagnet_file_reader
Developing repository for a python program that extracts information 
from an INTERMAGNET second-variation file with IAGA2002 format (sec extension).

The python script "file_reader.py" extracts the information from the sec file
and returns a pandas dataframe.

The columns of the dataframe are in the following order:

year month day day_of_year hour minute second h d z f

The project is currently under development to include other features.
